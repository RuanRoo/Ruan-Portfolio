    question: "PROBLEM SOLVING",
    answer:
      "My previous work experience has greatly impacted my ability to find creative solutions to problems. I approach problems by stepping back, doing thorough research, analysing the problem as well as the possible outcomes, to make the best decision in the process My creative side allows me to come up with out of the box ideas and solutions and view a problem from different perspectives.",

    question: "COMMUNICATION",
    answer:
      "Having worked with clients directly throughout most of my career in the service delivery industry, I had to learn early on how to effectively communicate to avoid misunderstanding that could negatively affect client outcomes and business objectives. I have learned how to communicate in a team setup (in office as well as remotely), how to properly delegate tasks efficiently to ensure the objective is clear, and also the ability to give and receive feedback on a regular basis. Working with demanding clients, I have learned how to empathise and how to effectively listen to be able to translate and act on information received.",

I am a reliable team player and in previous teams I have been known as the `go-to-guy` when anyone needs help or motivation. I enjoy building connections with team members which ultimately helps with workflow and creates a positive team culture.",
